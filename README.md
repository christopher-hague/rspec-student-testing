# rspec-student-testing

This repo was created in order to solidify my understanding of how to implement RSpec tests. spec/student_spec.rb contains a number of tests for the Student class, as defined in student.rb.

Feel free to fork and clone the repo to review and/or use it as a starting point for implementing your own RSpec tests. If you do not have RSpec be sure to install it by running 'gem install rspec'. Run the tests with 'rspec' in the terminal from the root directory to see the tests.
